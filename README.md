# Monte Carlo Study of OLS Asymptotics and RESET Test
## Overview

This project uses Monte Carlo simulations to study:

The asymptotic distribution of OLS under non-normal (χ²) errors.

The empirical size of Ramsey’s RESET test under correct specification.

All simulations are implemented in Stata.
